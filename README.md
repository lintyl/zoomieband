The app is a dashboard view of data that will be produced from the smart-collar. It uses CloudFirestore Firebase Login, Authentication, & Logout, Firestore Database, Heavy UI Branding and Layout Focus, PageView Navigation Bar, Passing data between custom views using @StateObject & @EnvironmentObject, and Custom Structs for Data

Design process included designing mockups on Figma before prototyping within XCode and design validation with customers, engineers, and veterinarians, while making sure to adhere to Apple standards of app design.
